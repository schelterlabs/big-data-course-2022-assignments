### Big Data Course 2022

#### Setup Test

In the first week, your task is to install Docker, download the Docker image we prepared, and use it to work through the [SetupTest notebook](SetupTest.ipynb).

You can find a guide on [how to setup your environment in our Docker instructions](docker_instructions.md). If you have difficulties with the installation, please consult the [troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md), where we collect known problems and solutions. Consult your TA if you can't get the environment to run on your machine.

#### Assignment 1

We have now made [Assignment 1](Assignment1.ipynb) available, which is due on Feb 22nd at 6pm.

In order to start to work on it, go the folder where you checked out the assignment repository previously:

`cd big-data-course-2022-assignments`

and use the following command to update the repository:

`git pull`

Finally, start the Docker container according to the [instructions](docker_instructions.md) given previously and open the _Assignment1.ipynb_ notebook in Jupyter.


#### Assignment 2
We will soon make the materials for the assignments available here.
