### Big Data Course 2022

#### Setup Test

In the first week, your task is to install Docker, download the Docker image we prepared, and use it to work through the [SetupTest notebook](SetupTest.ipynb).

You can find a guide on [how to setup your environment in our Docker instructions](docker_instructions.md). If you have difficulties with the installation, please consult the [troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md), where we collect known problems and solutions. Consult your TA if you can't get the environment to run on your machine.
